It is possible that you are tolerating yourself because [Chess](/wiki/Chess) is considered sport.
This question is very valid because, in general, we tend to associate sport with physical activity. However, that is not what characterizes sport. For an activity to be considered sport,
it must have fixed rules, be regulated by Federations and Confederations, present a competitive
character, benefit from victories with extrinsic rewards, such as medals, trophies and cash prizes. therefore,  it is clear that chess fits perfectly into the category sport.
