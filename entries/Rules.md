# **Rules**

[Chess](/wiki/Chess) is a competitive board game played between two participants. Each one is
represented by pieces of opposite colors, usually black and white. The objective of the game is
to conquer the **king**  of your opponent.

To play , you need a board composed of eight columns and eight rows, which results in 64 possible squares for the mobility of the pieces. The pieces are made up of eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen and a king.

Each piece has its own way of moving around the [board](/wiki/Board) . The pawn is only allowed frontal moves,
so that the first move of each pawn can cover two squares, the other moves are restricted to one
square ahead. Although it moves forward, the pawn's attack always occurs diagonally. The rook can run forward/backward/right/left with no restrictions on the number of squares. The knight
moves in an "L" shape (two squares in one direction and once square perpendicular to it),
in any direction. The movement of the bishop occurs, as in the case of rooks, without limitation
of squares, but only diagonally . The queen has free movement in the game. The king can only
be moved from square to square, even in any direction on the [board](/wiki/Board).

The movement of the pieces, by the players, is done based on a well-thought-out strategy. That's why chess is often used as an analogy for any other strategic actions, such as political actions, for example.

## Is it possible to move more than one piece at the same time in chess?

You can only move one piece at a time when it's your turn to play with one exception!
When you castle, you move the king and rook in the same move.
